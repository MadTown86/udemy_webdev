    <h2>My Top 3 Movies</h2>
    <hr>

    <h3>Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade</h3>
    <p>I really think Sean Connery and Harrison Ford had great synergy in this movie.</p>

    <h3>Ninja Scrolls</h3>
    <p>The scene where Ganmon (I Believe) tears off a guys arm.  The camera view pans from top down. He is holding an arm over his gaping maw, severed end down, gulping.  It was fantastic.</p>
    
    <h3>Caddyshack</h3>
    <p>Just an all around great cast and funny movie.  I could watch this on repeat and have on a day when there was nothing better to do.  Ah those were the days...</p>
