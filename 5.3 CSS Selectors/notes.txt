Syntax for CSS to style different elements


ELEMENT SELECTOR:
element {
    attribute: value
}

This one will alter the attribute for all of the <html> elements.  <h2> or <p> 
It is indiscriminate

CLASS SELECTOR:
.red-heading {
    color: red
}

This can be used to alter an attribute on many different elements

ID SELECTOR:
#main {
    attribute: value
}

This one alters said attribute's value for all elements that have id=#main

*When to use, the ID should be something completely unique, not used to ID and 'tag'
a bunch of different elements.

Choosing ELEMENTS WITH A SPECIFIC VALUE Syntax

all paragraphs that have said attribute are color red
p[attribute] {
    color: red
}

example: - only paragraphs that are draggable=True

p[draggable] {
    color: red
}
